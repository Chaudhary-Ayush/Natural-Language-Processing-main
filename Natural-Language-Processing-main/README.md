 # Natural-Language-Processing

Welcome to my Natural Language Processing (NLP) repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects and codes related to NLP that I've worked on during my graduation years. NLP is a fascinating branch of Artificial Intelligence that explores how systems and machines interact with and process human languages. Think of popular AI assistants like Alexa; they're prime examples of NLP in action.

What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
NLP focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and contextually appropriate. It encompasses a wide range of tasks and applications, from sentiment analysis to language translation, text summarization, and much more.
